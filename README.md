# Diep Userscript Collection
Contains a few scripts that actually work together

### Compatability
- ABC's wasm hook: yes
- Spade Squad server selector: yes
- Diep.Style: yes
- Sh√§dam's Unlag: yes
- Every other script as long as it does not deal with memory: probably lol

### Contents
- Memory Hook: Makes dieps memory accessable via window.diepMemory
- Healthbar: Makes all healthbars ingame visible (even for drones and other bullets etc)
- Rainbow: Fun rainbow theme, has no real use apart from triggering epilepsy
- (planned) Fov: Allows editing ones field of view; Maybe even with the mousewheel, idk yet
- (planned) Player-Coords: Display your own coordinates somewhere on the screen
- (planned) Leader-Coords: Display the leaders coordinates (maybe even with a distance to the players tank)
